# Never Sleep

This is just a nice looking page that stops your computer going to sleep. The use case is for when I am switching around on my KVM I do not want my other computers to sleep due to the mouse and keyboard no longer being connected. This gets around that. 


Go to [https://gcoulby.github.io/never-sleep/](https://gcoulby.github.io/never-sleep/) and keep the tab in the foreground when switching over the KVM. 



Go to [https://gcoulby.github.io/never-sleep/?no-image](https://gcoulby.github.io/never-sleep/?no-image) to disable the background image fetching.
